## Why

- Offers popular integrated AI image generation options from **Hugging Face**, **OpenAI**, and **Cloudflare**.
- Automatically hosts generated images on **Pinataâ€™s Web3 platform**, returning a usable URL immediately.
- Solves the hosting problem for developers who need to quickly store and access AI-generated images.
- Flexible, decentralized hosting without the need for centralized storage services.
  

### Why not

- Requires setting up Pinata API keys for hosting, which adds a bit of configuration overhead.
- You may need to manage API rate limits depending on the image generation tool used (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face).


## Prerequisite

- A valid Pinata account with access to API keys for file hosting.
- API keys or access tokens from **Hugging Face**, **OpenAI**, **Cloudflare**, or any supported AI image generation service.

## Install

```sh
npm install ai-generate-and-pinata-host@latest
